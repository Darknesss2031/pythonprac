As there is a student canteen at the university, I often go there for dinner after classes. There you may choose between different kinds of soup, meat and fish dishes and desserts. I often choose borsch for the first course and beefsteak for the second one. For dessert I often take stewed fruit or jelly. In our university canteen I usually have dinner with my friends. We may discuss our student life and make plans for the evening.
I often come home at about seven. As I am often hungry after a long day. I do not have a snack in the evening. My supper is a full meal. My mother usually cooks mashed potatoes with meat or sausages, and salads, of course. After supper I do my home work, play computer games and watch TV. Before going to bed I sometimes eat some fruit or drink fruit juice.
